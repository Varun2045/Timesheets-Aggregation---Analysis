# Timesheets Aggregation & Analysis (KNIME Workflow)

This repository contains a KNIME workflow for aggregating and analyzing timesheet data. The dashboard provides interactive charts, summary tables, and insights to help you understand work patterns, project allocation, and time management.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Aggregation of timesheet entries by employee, project, or time period
- Calculation of total and average hours worked
- Interactive visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, etc.)
- Summary statistics and actionable insights

## Requirements

- [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/downloads) (version 4.4 or higher recommended)
- Timesheets dataset (CSV or as specified in the workflow)
